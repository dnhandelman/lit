    <h2>American Spirits</h2>
    <p class="flexpoem">The universe is doing well. There are many planets. There are many planets we cannot see. Planets with names like
        MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the Milky Way galaxy there are 100 to 400 billion planets. If you want to name a planet
        you can. Name it anything you want.
        <br>

        A person on Earth looks at a computer screen. The person is Larry Page. Larry Page has named two planets. Larry
        Page is looking at his computer screen thinking about eternity, non-existence, prostate cancer. Larry Page is
        going to die. In his next life, Larry Page hopes to be a Solitary Eagle, i.e. Harpyhaliaetus solitarius. He will
        live in South America, soar above the Peruvian rain forest.

        <br>
        Elsewhere, a person watches a movie and laughs. Another person hides under a blanket and
        reads. Between the visible stars are more stars. Between Larry Page and the tree is twenty feet. 
        Between Larry Page&#39s mind and the world is his skin.
